The OrderBookEntry represents a row in the order book data set (i.e. a single order in the order book). It can be a bid or an ask order.

The OrderBook class presents a high level interface on all the orders in the order book data set, including query functions to find out which products are in the data set, and to retrieve a subset of the orders using filters.

The MerkelMain class represents the application itself, and it deals with user input and menu printing.
